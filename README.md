## Motivation

A simple Google Chrome extension that replaces the “New Tab” page. Note that the life expectancy is not accurate, but it reminds me that time is actually being used up.

### Setup:

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/raichur/motivation.git`
3. Customize the 'vars.js' variables.
4. Open Extensions from under the wrench menu.
5. Check “Developer Mode” if necessary and click “Load Unpacked Extension”.
6. Select the motivation directory.
7. Open a new tab.
